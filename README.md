### Features Left to Implement

- A custom made youtube video which detailed meet times and general promotional info.

## Testing 
- Header and footer nav elements were not lining up correctly at mobile screen sizes. Rectified this with the use of media queries for both header and footer navs.
- Images were not displaying when page was deployed to github pages. Rectified this by changing image file extensions to upper case and removing any underscores in image file names. Known issue ith github pages.
- Contact form displaying code institute dump page but not displaying any data that was submitted. Corrected form perameters to get rather than post in html rectified iss
- Images were not coded optimally and were returning poor lighthouse and HTML validator results, issues now rectified.
- Tested site loading and responsiveness in the following browsers: Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome and everything performed as expected with all images loading 
  and nav items changing as needed for smaller screen sizes.


### Validator Testing 

- HTML
- No errors displayed when code was run through HTML Validator ![html validator](/assets/images/Screenshots/Screenshot%20html-validator.png)
- CSS
- No errors displayed when code was run through CSS Validator  ![CSS Validator](/assets/images/Screenshots/Screenshot%20Css-validation.png)


## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub) 

 - The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
 
- In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
 From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch.
- Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
- As stated above, I initially had issues with images not displaying. Having checked an article on slack overflow (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41468951/images-not-displaying-in-github-pages) I was able to correct the issue by amending the image file name and path.
